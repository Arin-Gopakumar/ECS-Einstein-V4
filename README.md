# Kepler AI V1.1

## Overview

This project utilizes a mechanical robot to perform object detection and classification using a deep-learning model from Roboflow. The robot can be controlled via a PS4 controller, and the system provides real-time video capture and processing.

## Features

- Real-time object detection and classification (low, medium, high confidence levels)
- Robot control via PS4 controller
- Tumor tracking and biopsy simulation
- Recording and saving video feed


## Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries:
- bash
- pip install rpyc opencv-python pygame numpy ftd2xx
- git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kepler-ai.git
- cd kepler-ai
- ./rpyc_server.sh
- inference server start
